        <h2>Cat Senses</h2>
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only one-sixth the
              light level required for human vision. This is partly the result
              of cat eyes having a tapetum lucidum, which reflects any light
              that passes through the retina back into the eye, thereby
              increasing the eye's sensitivity to dim light.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Hearing</h3>
            <p>
              The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of 500 Hz to
              32 kHz. It can detect an extremely broad range of frequencies
              ranging from 55 Hz to 79,000 Hz. It can hear a range of 10.5
              octaves, while humans and dogs can hear ranges of about 9 octaves.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Smell</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have an acute sense of smell, due in part to their
              well-developed olfactory bulb and a large surface of olfactory
              mucosa, about 5.8 square centimetres (29⁄32 square inch) in area,
              which is about twice that of humans. Cats and many other animals
              have a Jacobson's organ in their mouths that is used in the
              behavioral process of flehmening.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Taste</h3>
            <p>
              Cats have relatively few taste buds compared to humans (470 or so
              versus more than 9,000 on the human tongue). Domestic and wild
              cats share a taste receptor gene mutation that keeps their sweet
              taste buds from binding to sugary molecules, leaving them with no
              ability to taste sweetness.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Whiskers</h3>
            <p>
              To aid with navigation and sensation, cats have dozens of movable
              whiskers (vibrissae) over their body, especially their faces.
              These provide information on the width of gaps and on the location
              of objects in the dark, both by touching objects directly and by
              sensing air currents; they also trigger protective blink reflexes
              to protect the eyes from damage
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-4 col-md-3">
            <h3>Balance</h3>
            <p>
              Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to
              be slightly more active at night. Domestic cats spend the majority
              of their time in the vicinity of their homes, but can range many
              hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish
              territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging
              from 7 to 28 hectares (17–69 acres).
